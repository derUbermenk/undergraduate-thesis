  This repository contains all scripts written for my undergraduate thesis, "Shoreline Change Analysis of Cagliliog, 
  Tinambac, Camarines Sur, Philippines  Using CoastSat, QGIS, and CoastCR," conducted with 
  Bruzo RA and Casasis GK. Our goal was to develop a fully open-source workflow by ensuring data 
  interoperability between the different tools we used.
</p>

<p>
  <i>The data, collected and used in the undergraduate thesis project is also located in here.</i>
</p>

The following tools were essential for the completion of this project:
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.qgis.org/en/site/">QGIS</a> for data visualization
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://qgis.org/pyqgis/master/">pyqgis</a> for creating and manipulating QGIS geometries and features
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/kvos/CoastSat">CoastSat</a> for automating shoreline and shoreline transect intersection detection
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/alejandro-gomez/CoastCR">CoastCR</a> for calculating shoreline change statistics
  </li>
</ul>

The scripts I wrote for this project were used for the following:
<ul>
  <li>
      <p>
    automate the creation of shoreline transects to be used for the detection of shoreline positions  
    </p>
